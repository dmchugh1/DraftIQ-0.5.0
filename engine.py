"""
DraftIQ Engine
==============
Consolidated, de-duplicated version of the DraftIQ draft assistant.

Source consolidation notes (kept for reference):
- calculate_position_urgency: 6 identical copies collapsed to 1 (was v0.3.10)
- calculate_draft_urgency: kept v0.3.9 (most developed), dropped earlier plain version
- get_draft_recommendations: kept v0.3.8 (most developed), dropped plain + v0.3.7
- what_if_i_wait: kept the non-simulation version. The "simulation-based" version
  called simulated_next_pick_probability(), which was never defined anywhere in the
  source material, so it would crash. If you want real simulation-backed wait
  probabilities, build_simulation_scores()/simulate_draft_path_fast() below can be
  wired up to power that later.
- Fixed: availability_score() referenced an undefined `drafted_players` global — this
  function was unused elsewhere (superseded by next_pick_probability) and dropped.
- Fixed: tier_table used to be computed once at import time and never refreshed, so
  tiers silently went stale as the draft progressed. It's now recomputed on demand.
- Fixed: get_roster_needs() only ever returns "HIGH"/"OK", never "MEDIUM" — the
  "MEDIUM" branches in calculate_draftiq_score/compare_players were dead code and
  are left out.
- Fixed: player-team indexing. MY_TEAM/settings["user_slot"] are 1-indexed team
  numbers; draft_state now stores a consistent 0-indexed "user_team_index".
- All state (league, draft_state, players_df) now lives on a DraftIQEngine instance
  instead of module-level globals, so it behaves correctly under a web server.
- All display()/print()-based output has been converted to return values (dicts /
  list-of-dicts) so the Flask layer can render them.
